    abstract = {EventScript is a simple but powerful language for programming
                reactive processes. A stream of incoming events is matched
                against a regular expression. Actions embedded within the regular
                expression are executed in response to the matching of patterns
                of events. These actions include assigning computed values to
                variables and emitting output events. The definition of
                EventScript presented a number of novel and interesting
                language-design choices. EventScript has an efficient
                implementation, and has been used in a development environment
                for complex event-based applications. We have used EventScript to
                program both small examples and large industrial applications.
                Readers of EventScript programs find them easy to understand, and
                are comfortable with the familiar model of matching regular
                expressions.},
